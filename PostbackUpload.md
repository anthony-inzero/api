<h1>Default Postback and Postback On Upload</h1>

<h2>Differences</h2>
While default postback and postback on upload are largely similar, default postback requires an XML response specifying validity of the scan while postback on upload has the device determine the success or failure on capture and allows the user to change the response to an appropriate value afterwards.
